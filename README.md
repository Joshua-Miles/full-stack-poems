# Full Stack Poems

### Setup
* `cd` into the backend, migrate the database, seed the database, and start the server
* Open `index.html` in your browser

### Deliverables
1. Get the poems from the database, into index.js, and use the `renderPoemList` function to display them
2. Add the ability for a user to delete a poem (this should update the page and persist)
3. Add the ability for a user to create a new poem (this should update the page and persist)
